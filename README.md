Av1an is a video encoding Rust library and command-line tool designed to be as fast as possible, easy to use, and extremely extensible. It supports a wide variety of encoders and tools to produce high quality videos.

## Features

* Support for Windows, Linux, and MacOS
* [Docker builds](./california-condor/docs/docker.md) (published legacy Av1an images may not contain Condor)
* Hyper-scalable video encoding
* Cancel and resume at any time without losing progress
* Real-time progress feedback
* Terminal User Interface (TUI)
* Modular architecture for custom workflows

### Video Filtering

Av1an is built with [FFMS2][ffms2] for simple decoding but also supports [VapourSynth][vapoursynth] for advanced filtering and analysis.

* Decode the input video with either the [FFMS2][ffms2], [BestSource][vs-bestsource], [L-SMASH-Works][vs-lsmash], or [DGDecNV][vs-dgdecnv] VapourSynth plugin
* Pass a VapourSynth Python script (`.vpy` or `.py`) as the input
* Apply custom variables to the VapourSynth script
* Output a specific track/index from the VapourSynth script
* Apply additional VapourSynth filters such as [Trim][vs-trim], [Crop][vs-crop], [Resize][vs-resize], and [Splice][vs-splice]

### Video Encoding

Av1an supports the following encoder executables:

- [aomenc][aom] - Alliance for Open Media reference AV1 encoder
- [SvtAv1EncApp][svt-av1] - Scalable Video Technology for AV1 AV1 encoder
- [rav1e][rav1e] - Rust AV1 encoder
- [avmenc][avm] - Alliance for Open Media AOM Video Model reference AV2 encoder
- [vpxenc][vpx] - WebM VP8/VP9 encoder
- [x264][x264] - x264 H.264 encoder
- [x265][x265] - x265 H.265 encoder
- [vvenc][vvenc] - Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder H.266 encoder
- [FFmpeg][ffmpeg] - FFmpeg

### Video Analysis

Av1an can analyze video properties and qualities to improve encoded video quality by:

* Splitting the video into contiguous scenes
* Scaling Photon Noise ISO based on the level of noise/grain in each scene
* Finding the most efficient quantizer for each scene for a given quality target
* Choosing the appropriate encoding speed for each scene

## Getting Started

### Installation

The CLI's Cargo package is **`california-condor`**; its executable is **`condor`**.
As of 2026-11-13, this package is unpublished on crates.io (`condor` there is an
unrelated project), and the checked upstream releases do not provide Condor ZIPs.
Use a checkout containing this workspace, not a legacy Av1an default-branch clone.
After installing the [build prerequisites](./california-condor/docs/compiling.md),
run from the repository root:

```bash
cargo install --locked --path california-condor --bin condor
```

**Windows:** this copies only `condor.exe`, not its required DLLs. Follow the
[Windows runtime/build instructions](./california-condor/docs/installation.md#installation)
instead of using this command alone.

See [Installation](./california-condor/docs/installation.md) for package availability,
future release bundles and runtime dependencies, and [Docker](./california-condor/docs/docker.md)
for upstream image policy and local Condor builds.

### Usage

#### California Condor CLI

The Av1an CLI, California Condor, uses a single JSON configuration file to manage the entire encoding process. Each step can also be executed individually with its own command. You can use `--help` on each command for details on how to use them (e.g. `condor --help`, `condor detect-scenes --help`, `condor target-quality --help`). For a complete guide on using California Condor, see the [California Condor README](./california-condor/README.md) and [guide](https://rust-av.github.io/Av1an/guide.html). For a quick start, see the example below.

*Encode a 1080p 10-bit AV1 video with Film Grain Synthesis using rav1e. Use FFMS2 to decode the input. Downscale the scene detection input to 540p to detect scenes faster. Target a SSIMULACRA 2 quality score of 85 quickly. Use mkvmerge to concatenate the output video.*

```bash
condor \
    --temp "./deletemelater" \
    --logs "./deletemelater/condor.log" \
    --config-file "./deletemelater/config.json" \
    --input "bird takeoff.mp4" \
    --output "bird takeoff.mkv" \
    --decoder "vs-ffms2" \
    --filters "resize:scaler=bilinear;width=1920;height=1080;format=yuv420p10le" \
    --scd-filters "resize:scaler=bilinear;width=540;height=960;" \
    --encoder "rav1e" \
    --params "--speed 4" \
    --photon-noise 800 \
    --target-metric "ssimulacra2" \
    --target 85 \
    --target-profile "fast" \
    --concat "mkvmerge"
```

#### Andean Condor Library

The Av1an library, Andean Condor, consists of the following components: `Input`, `Output`, `Encoder`, `Scene`, and `Sequence`. These components are managed with a single `Condor` instance. See the [library example](./andean-condor/examples/simple.rs) and [local dependency setup](./california-condor/docs/index.md#library); `andean-condor` is not yet published on crates.io.

##### Library cancellation

Keep one `andean_condor::utils::cancellation::Cancellation` and pass it through
`Input::ensure_indexed_cancel`, `AndeanCondor::process_all_cancel` (or
`process_one_cancel`), and `Sequence::execute_cancel`. Clone the token for the
application's cancellation controls; do not create a token per pass.

```rust
use andean_condor::utils::cancellation::Cancellation;

let cancellation = Cancellation::default();
let controls = cancellation.clone();
controls.request()?; // Graceful: finish admitted scenes, including both passes.
controls.request()?; // Forced: stop feeds, kill owned trees, join workers, reap.
```

Direct encoder, filter, zone/probe, indexing, and concat APIs also have `_cancel`
entry points. Fresh jobs do not admit work after cancellation. Errors retain a typed
`Cancelled::Forced` cause through anyhow context. Existing `Arc<AtomicBool>`
entry points remain available but cannot request force. Custom `Sequence`
implementations must override `execute_cancel` to support forced child teardown;
the default bridge exposes only the legacy flag. For manual scene pipelines,
call `root.admit()?` once and pass that view through all passes/filter setup;
keep the root for admitting the next scene. Custom `AndeanCondor`
implementations must supply the new `process_one_cancel`/`process_all_cancel` methods.

Native decoder/plugin calls already in progress must finish; arbitrary hung
foreign calls cannot be interrupted safely. Unix children use private process
groups; Windows uses suspended creation and kill-on-close Job Objects (native
Windows acceptance remains pending). Deliberately escaping a managed group/job
is not supported. These library APIs do not register signals or change the CLI's
keyboard, terminal-exit, or exit-code behavior.

Unix hosts must not externally reap managed children or enable `SIGCHLD=SIG_IGN` /
`SA_NOCLDWAIT` while their guards are active. Auto-reap dispositions are rejected
before spawn; detected lost ownership is reported without signaling stale IDs.
This check cannot protect against concurrent external waiters. Use piped or null
stdin for managed children: inherited terminal input may stop a background group.
