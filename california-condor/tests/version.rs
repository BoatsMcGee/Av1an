//! Tests for `condor --version`.

//! `--version` prints the three "installed" tables — VapourSynth plugins,
//! encoders, and quality metric libraries — and the last of those is what

//! loadable or it is not, and CI runners generally have none of them. The

//! particular library being present, and only the rows for libraries that
//! actually loaded are checked for details.
