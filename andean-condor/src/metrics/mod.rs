//! Native quality metrics, and the decode/probe driver they share.
//!
//! Comparing an encode against its source means reading two clips, pairing the
//! frames the pass selected, and handing each pair to a metric. That part is
//! identical for every metric, so it lives in [`probe`] behind one driver,
//! [`probe::probe_selected_frames`]. A metric module supplies only a scorer and
//! an adaptor from the driver's [`PlaneSet`] to its own descriptor, so the
//! driver stays free of any metric crate's types.
//!
//! The three native libraries are opened with `dlopen` and may be absent;
//! [`availability`] reports that for every library at once, for `condor
//! --version`.
//!
//! # Choosing an engine
//!
//! SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and CVVDP have three interchangeable-looking but
//! numerically distinct implementations: libvship on the GPU, fmetrics on the
//! CPU, and the VapourSynth plugins. They do not agree to the last digit, so
//! which one produced a number is recorded alongside it.
//!
//! [`engine`] decides the order, rather than each call site restating it:
//!
//! | input | order | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | VapourSynth | vship → plugin → fmetrics | the graph already exists, so a plugin costs only the metric, while fmetrics costs ~1.4x more |
//! | FFMS2 | vship → fmetrics → plugin | there is no graph, and building one purely to run a metric costs more than the metric |
//!
//! fmetrics also does not honour a configured `resolution` -- it scores at the
//! source size.
