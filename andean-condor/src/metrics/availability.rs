//! Runtime availability of the native metric libraries.
//!
//! libvship and libvmaf are opened with `dlopen` at runtime, so whether a given
//! installation can use the native path is a property of the machine, not of
//! the build. The scoring modules answer that question one metric at a time --
//! [`vship::native_supported`](super::vship::native_supported) and
//! [`fmetrics::native_supported`](super::fmetrics::native_supported) decide
//! per metric -- which is the right shape for dispatch but the wrong one for
//! reporting: a user asking what their installation supports wants the whole
//! picture at once.
//!
//! [`libraries`] collects that picture. It answers only what is loaded on this
//! system, deliberately not what would be used for a given clip, because the
//! choice between engines also depends on how the input is decoded (see
//! [`super::Engine`]) and on per-metric model limits.
//!
//! Nothing here can fail. Each probe returns a bool or an `Option`, so a
//! machine with none of these libraries reports all of them absent rather than
//! erroring, which is what lets `condor --version` print this unconditionally.
