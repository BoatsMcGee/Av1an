//! The decode/probe driver shared by every native metric.
//!
//! Comparing an encode against its source means pairing two clips frame by
//! frame and handing each pair to a metric. Everything that is the same for
//! every metric lives here: choosing a reader per side, seeking or advancing to
//! each selected frame, checking the two clips agree on geometry, and calling
//! back with the planes of one pair.
//!
//! The plane descriptor is declared locally rather than imported from a metric
//! crate. Keeping [`PlaneSource`] here is what lets this module stay
//! metric-agnostic: a metric that needs a different type adapts the set inside
//! its own `submit` callback instead of the driver depending on that crate.
