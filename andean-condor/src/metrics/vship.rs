//! Native libvship scoring for SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli and CVVDP.
//!
//! libvship implements the same three perceptual metrics Av1an exposes as
//! VapourSynth plugins, but behind a C API rather than a filter graph. Binding
//! it directly lets the pass decode only the frames it selected and hand each
//! pair straight to the device, with no temporary files and no distortion maps.
//!
//! Everything that is not metric-specific lives in [`super::probe`]: opening
//! the two clips, walking the selection, and keeping each frame's planes alive
//! across the submission. This module supplies only the mapping from Av1an's
//! [`QualityMetric`] to a [`VshipConfig`], the plane adaptor, and the driver
//! loop that submits each pair.
//!
//! # Availability and fallback
//!
//! libvship ships as a VapourSynth plugin and is opened with `dlopen` at
//! runtime, so it may be absent. [`is_available`] reports whether the library
//! loaded and a device passed libvship's full check. When it has, this path is
//! preferred over the plugin branches; when it has not, or if scoring fails at
//! any point, the caller falls back to those branches, whose behaviour is
//! unchanged.
//!
//! # Temporal metrics
//!
//! CVVDP accumulates across the frames a handler has seen, so
//! [`VshipScorer`] builds it exactly one handler and sees every frame in order.
//! This selection owner requests history-only resets at actual source gaps.
//! Disabled-temporal mode instead resets history and score after every frame.
