# .SYNOPSIS
#     Downloads the TransNetV2 ONNX model for neural scene detection.
#
# .DESCRIPTION
#     condor never downloads the model at runtime: it searches for
#     `transnetv2.onnx` at, in order,
#
#       1. the `model_path` set on the TransNetV2 scene detection method,
#       2. $TRANSNETV2_MODEL_PATH,
#       3. model/transnetv2.onnx beside the condor executable,
#       4. transnetv2.onnx beside the condor executable,
#       5. the per-user cache directory.
#
#     This script downloads the model into the current directory and prints
#     the environment variable that points condor at it. The download is
#     verified against a pinned sha256 before it is moved into place, so an
#     interrupted download can never pass for the real model.
#
#     Releases already ship the model at model/transnetv2.onnx beside the
#     condor executable, where it is found with no environment variable set;
#     this script is for source builds and custom layouts.
#
# .ENVIRONMENT
#     DESTINATION              Where to place the model. Defaults to the
#                              current directory.
#     TRANSNETV2_MODEL_URL     Download source override.
#     TRANSNETV2_MODEL_SHA256  Expected digest override.
#

#     ./install-transnetv2-model-linux.sh

Set this environment variable to use the install:

  export TRANSNETV2_MODEL_PATH='$Destination/transnetv2.onnx'

Add it to your shell rc to persist. Not needed when the model sits at
model/transnetv2.onnx beside the condor binary, which is where a release
stages it; the scene detector searches there on its own. The model_path on
the TransNetV2 scene detection method in condor.json also wins over the
environment variable.

Verify with:

  condor detect-scenes --method transnetv2
