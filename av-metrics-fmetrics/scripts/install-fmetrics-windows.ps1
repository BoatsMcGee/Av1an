.SYNOPSIS
    Builds fmetrics from source and installs the shared library for Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Installs fmetrics so av-metrics-fmetrics can load it at runtime with
    `libloading`. Unlike libvship and libvmaf, fmetrics publishes no prebuilt
    Windows binaries and nothing installable from a package mirror, so this
    fetches a pinned commit and compiles it with Zig.

    That makes this the one install script here that needs a toolchain: Zig
    0.16.0 and Git. Zig 0.17 is refused because it removed `b.build_root`, which
    the pinned `build.zig` still uses.

    Built from BoatsMcGee/fmetrics, which adds what upstream lacks: a
    shared-library target to load at all, and a patch making fcvvdp compile on
    Windows, where it calls POSIX-only `sysconf()`.

    The library is installed as `fmetrics.dll`, the first name `library_names`
    offers on Windows.

.PARAMETER Destination
    Where to place `fmetrics.dll`. Defaults to `$PWD\fmetrics`.

.PARAMETER Commit
    The full commit ID to build. Defaults to the standalone pin below.

.PARAMETER ZigPath
    `zig` to look up on `PATH`, or a path to `zig.exe`.

    .\install-fmetrics-windows.ps1
