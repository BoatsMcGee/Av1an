# .SYNOPSIS
#     Builds fmetrics from source and installs the shared library for Linux.
#
# .DESCRIPTION
#     Installs fmetrics so av-metrics-fmetrics can load it at runtime with
#     `libloading`. fmetrics publishes no prebuilt Linux binaries and nothing
#     installable from a package mirror, so this fetches a pinned commit and
#     compiles it with Zig.
#
#     That makes this the one install script here that needs a toolchain: Zig
#     0.16.0, Git and a C compiler. Zig 0.17 is refused because it removed
#     `b.build_root`, which the pinned `build.zig` still uses.
#
#     Built from BoatsMcGee/fmetrics rather than halidecx/fmetrics, which
#     carries the shared-library target upstream lacks. The fcvvdp patch the
#     Windows script applies is not needed here: it works around POSIX
#     `sysconf()`, which does not compile on Windows and does on Linux.
#
#     `zig build -Dshared=true` is deliberately not used. It links the static
#     archive the ordinary way, so the linker pulls in only those members that
#     resolve an undefined symbol, and nothing references them, which leaves a
#     library exporting nothing at all. Windows is unaffected because
#     `win32_module_definition` (src/fmetrics.def) forces the members in; ELF
#     gets no export list, so the failure is Linux-only. Zig 0.16 offers no
#     whole-archive option, so the library is linked here instead.
#
#     This script is standalone: it needs no repository checkout and nothing
#     beside itself. The release pipeline overrides the pins below with
#     environment variables instead of editing the defaults.
#
# .PARAMETER Destination
#     Where to place `libfmetrics.so`. Defaults to `$PWD/fmetrics`.
#
# .PARAMETER Commit
#     The full commit ID to build. Defaults to the standalone pin below.
#
# .PARAMETER Quiet
#     Suppress the environment-variable guidance printed at the end.
#
# .EXAMPLE
#     ./install-fmetrics-linux.sh

#     ./install-fmetrics-linux.sh -Destination /usr/lib -Quiet

Set this environment variable to use the install:

  export FMETRICS_LIB_DIR='$Destination'

Not needed when the library sits beside the condor binary, which is where a
release stages it; the crate searches there on its own.

Verify with:

  cargo test -p av-metrics-fmetrics

Those tests skip themselves when the library is absent, so a pass alone does not
prove it loaded.
