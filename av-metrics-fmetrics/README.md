# av-metrics-fmetrics

Native CPU perceptual quality scoring (SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli, CVVDP, IW-SSIM, MS-SSIM)
via the [fmetrics](https://github.com/halidecx/fmetrics) C API.

## Features

- SSIMULACRA2, Butteraugli, CVVDP, IW-SSIM and MS-SSIM
- Frames come from `av_decoders`, so a clip can be read from Y4M, FFMS2, FFmpeg or a
  VapourSynth script without this crate knowing which
- Loaded with `dlopen` at runtime, so the crate compiles on machines without it and
  `is_available()` reports `false`
- Scores pairs as they are decoded, so no temporary files and no distortion maps

## Supported runtime ABI

The loader accepts only the exact `fmetrics_version_str()` value `0.1.0`, from
[pinned commit ae87c8e](https://github.com/BoatsMcGee/fmetrics/tree/ae87c8e5607063f0dcc8241b52cb143f6c9ad4ac).
Null, non-UTF8 and other versions return `FmetricsError::IncompatibleLibrary`
before any workspace/context allocation. Rebuild that revision and set
`FMETRICS_LIB_PATH` to its library directory. An opened incompatible binary is
not silently replaced by another candidate, and there is no compatibility override.
This is a bounded ABI policy, not attestation of arbitrary modified binaries.

Native statuses use integer-safe `FmetricsErr`: known associated constants keep
their names; `.0` replaces enum casts. `from_raw` preserves every code, and only
zero is success. Unknown errors retain the original integer in `CallFailed`.
Input-only image formats/colorspaces and display models remain typed enums.
The `m14_` tests compile vendored, unmodified public headers with a C11 compiler;
ordinary crate builds need no compiler, headers or fmetrics installation.

## Usage

```rust
use av_decoders::Decoder;
use av_metrics_fmetrics::{ColorInfo, FmetricsConfig, FmetricsMetric, FmetricsScorer};

let config = FmetricsConfig::new(FmetricsMetric::Ssimulacra2);

let mut reference = Decoder::from_file("reference.mkv")?;
let mut distorted = Decoder::from_file("distorted.mkv")?;

let reference_color = ColorInfo::from_details(reference.get_video_details())?;
let distorted_color = ColorInfo::from_details(distorted.get_video_details())?;
let mut scorer = FmetricsScorer::new_with_colors(config, reference_color, distorted_color)?;

// Submit pairs as they are decoded; the caller owns frame lifetime.
let score = scorer.submit_pair(&reference_planes, &distorted_planes)?;
println!("SSIMULACRA2: {}", score.require(FmetricsMetric::Ssimulacra2)?);
```

### Choosing a metric

| Metric        | Direction        | Notes                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Ssimulacra2` | higher is better | Perceptual, matches libvship's naming |
| `Butteraugli` | lower is better  | A distance, not a quality measure     |
| `Cvvdp`       | higher is better | Temporal; `cvvdp_jod` is the headline |
| `Iwssim`      | higher is better | Needs at least 16 px per dimension    |
| `Msssim`      | higher is better | Needs at least 16 px per dimension    |

`FmetricsMetric::prefers_lower_is_better()` states the direction, so pooling does
not have to be re-derived at each call site.

### CVVDP temporal modes

CVVDP defaults to **60 fps** when `with_frame_rate` is not called. Supply the
source rate when known; explicit values must be finite and satisfy
**0 < fps <= 100000**. Zero (including negative zero), negatives, NaN, infinities
and larger rates return `InvalidConfiguration` before library loading or native
allocation, including when temporal processing is disabled. Direct writes to the
public `frame_rate` field receive the same validation. Non-CVVDP metrics ignore it.
Andean always forwards its explicit source rate, including invalid values, rather
than replacing it with the default.

The default and inclusive bound follow the
[pinned Vship plugin](https://codeberg.org/Line-fr/Vship/src/commit/5a627933274196219f782b3b74e13fad47cd6370/src/HIP/cvvdp/vapoursynth.hpp#L191-L195).
Unlike the plugin's metadata sanitization, explicit invalid input is rejected.
The bound limits FPS-driven temporal ring growth; it does not guarantee enough
memory for every accepted rate and resolution.

```rust
# use av_metrics_fmetrics::{FmetricsConfig, FmetricsMetric};
let config = FmetricsConfig::new(FmetricsMetric::Cvvdp).with_frame_rate(24.0);
```

By default (`disable_temporal=false`), one context sees every submitted frame in
order and returns native accumulated JOD/quality values unchanged. Use
`with_disable_temporal(true)` for independent frames: after each successful
compute the wrapper clears **both history and accumulated score**, matching
Vship's VapourSynth `disableTemporal` behavior. Reset failures return errors, not
successful scores.

`with_reset_on_discontinuity(true)` is a separate, default-on source-gap policy;
neither builder changes the other. Selection owners know the actual source
indices. fmetrics 0.1.0 has **no history-only reset**: public `reset_temporal()`
clears accumulation too. Andean therefore rejects enabled-temporal CVVDP with
noncontiguous selections before context creation, scoring or callbacks, allowing
its existing backend fallback. Contiguous or disabled-temporal CVVDP still works.
The CVVDP plugin fallback cannot perform history-only gap resets either and
rejects that selection too; native Vship supports it. Neither fallback silently
changes the requested temporal semantics.
Low-level callers may explicitly choose `with_reset_on_discontinuity(false)` and
intentionally carry history across selected source gaps; the scorer itself has
no source indices. Do not use the combined reset as a history-only substitute.

Stateful `m15_` C ABI tests prove wrapper/reset/driver behavior, not CVVDP numeric
accuracy. The `m16_` tests also check native FPS arguments and rejection before
native probes/allocations using harmless ABI sinks, not real temporal rings.
Real Vship-vs-plugin parity requires a supported GPU and plugin; run
`AV_METRICS_REQUIRE_CVVDP_PARITY=1 cargo +stable test --profile ci -p andean-condor m15_native_vs_plugin -- --nocapture` on that host. Missing runtime/plugin fails
that required gate; ordinary suites report it UNEXECUTED.

### Colour

fmetrics takes **interleaved RGB**, not planar YUV, so every pair is converted
before submission. That makes the conversion part of the measurement: a wrong
matrix silently changes every score. `ColorInfo::from_details` honors each input's
decoded range and BT.601, BT.709 or BT.2020 non-constant-luminance matrix.
`new_with_colors` keeps the two inputs independent; `new` is shorthand only when
both inputs are known to have the same color properties.

Only absent/`Unspecified` values use defaults: limited range, BT.709 above 650
lines (BT.601 otherwise), and sRGB transfer/BT.709 primaries. BT.709, SMPTE 170M,
and BT.2020 10/12-bit SDR transfers are interpreted using BT.1886 gamma 2.4,
linearized and encoded as sRGB. Existing sRGB and linear RGB retain their encoded
values and matching native tags. `ColorInfo::transfer` describes the source;
`ColorInfo::colorspace` describes the output. Only BT.709 primaries are supported;
other gamuts and unsupported transfers (including PQ/HLG) return
`UnsupportedFormat`. An HDR flag or display model is not an input decoder.
`colorspace_from_details` now returns a `Result`; `ColorInfo::colorspace` carries
the supported encoding through to the native image descriptor.

av-decoders 0.12 populates color metadata through FFMS2/FFmpeg. For VapourSynth,
get the backend with `get_vapoursynth_impl()`, then call its
`get_extended_video_details()` to read the first output frame's properties;
ordinary decoder details omit them. Y4M has no color metadata
in this decoder and therefore uses the defaults. These are clip-level properties;
per-frame changes and mastering-display/content-light-level rendering are not
implemented here. Chroma reconstruction remains nearest-cell sampling.
The metric converter uses published `yuvxyb` 0.6.0 (MIT, Rust 1.95 minimum), with
root default features disabled. Its transitive `yuvxyb-math` 0.1.1 still enables
its default `fastmath` polynomial powers; approximate math is **not** all disabled.
Independent numeric regressions cover the matrix, meaningful source depth and
SDR transfer conversion. FMA target features may change last-bit results in the
library's floating-point/fastmath path; high-depth SDR gray regressions allow
four u16 codes (<0.007% full scale) against standard gamma-2.4 + piecewise sRGB.
No dependency fork or alternate handwritten path exists.

yuvxyb clamps normalized luma to [0, 1] and chroma to [-0.5, 0.5] **before** the
matrix, including samples outside nominal limited range. Invalid stored codes
outside the meaningful source depth are rejected. Valid odd 4:2:0/4:2:2 input is
edge-padded for the library, then cropped to the original dimensions without
resizing. Source plane geometry and readable spans are checked before copying
into owned frames. `PlaneSource<'a>`/`PlaneSet<'a>` have private geometry and borrow
live storage: use fallible `PlaneSource::from_bytes`, `from_u16`, or
`PlaneSet::from_frame(&frame)`. Strides (including negative bottom-up strides)
and origins are **bytes**, even for u16. Zero geometry, unsupported sample sizes,
short strides/buffers, invalid origins and offset/native-width overflow return
`MalformedFrame`. `PlaneSet::new` groups checked planes; `yuv_to_rgb` is safe,
checks depth/storage/peak and chroma agreement, and returns owned `RgbImage`.
Unsupported color/depth/peak/library conversions return `UnsupportedFormat`.

`RgbView::new(&bytes, width, height, wide)` now returns a `Result`: packed RGB
must cover every row and fit native `c_uint` geometry. Wide RGB uses native-endian
u16 samples: borrowed byte slices must be u16-aligned or return `MalformedFrame`;
owned wide images use `Vec<u16>` to guarantee alignment for native uint16_t reads.
Their byte views retain native byte order, not a portable little-endian encoding.
Planar u16 input still supports unaligned origins via unaligned reads. `RgbSource` is sealed.
`as_img` on an image/view returns `BorrowedImg<'_>`, keeping storage borrowed
until its last use. `as_raw()` exposes the unchanged `repr(C)` `FmetricsImg` for
unsafe native interoperability, not for safe submission. Raw plane adapters use
`unsafe PlaneSource::from_raw_parts(pointer, actual_span_bytes, width, height,
stride_bytes, origin_bytes, sample_bytes)`; callers must prove the actual live
allocation, initialized visible samples and immutable lifetime. Checked required
extent is not proof of allocation length. Padding is never read or exposed as a
slice: Andean carries native allocation lengths and VS's guaranteed span through
the last visible row, excluding unpromised final padding. Borrowed views cannot
escape frame-owned callbacks.

TransNetV2 keeps its model-specific fractional box-average preprocessing; routing
it through an integer-only YUV interface would change quantization/filter order.
Unrecognized raw numeric metadata may already be collapsed to `None` by the
decoder; this API cannot distinguish that from an absent property.

Bit depth maps directly: 8-bit becomes `RGB_UINT8`, and 10- or 12-bit is
up-converted to `RGB_UINT16` rather than truncated, which would discard precision
the source has. Other depths are rejected rather than silently rescaled.

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.97 or newer
- fmetrics, built with Zig 0.16.0

fmetrics is distributed as a source library rather than a prebuilt install, and
has no shared-library target upstream, so the library is built from a branch
carrying that work.

## Installing fmetrics

Unlike libvship and libvmaf there is no prebuilt Windows binary and no Linux
package to install, so this is a source build. It needs Zig 0.16.x and Git;
0.17 is refused because it removed `b.build_root`, which the pinned `build.zig`
uses.

### Windows

```powershell
winget install --id zig.zig --version 0.16.0 --exact
.\scripts\install-fmetrics-windows.ps1
```

The script fetches a pinned commit, runs `zig build --fetch` to populate the
dependency tree, patches fcvvdp (it calls POSIX `sysconf()`, which does not
compile on Windows), builds `fmetrics.dll`, and installs it to `$PWD\fmetrics`.

`-Destination` chooses another directory; the script prints the
`SetEnvironmentVariable` line that points the crate at it.

### Linux

Needs Zig 0.16.x, Git and a C compiler:

```sh
./scripts/install-fmetrics-linux.sh
```

The script fetches a pinned commit, builds the static library, and links
`libfmetrics.so` by hand — `zig build -Dshared=true` is broken on ELF and yields
a library exporting nothing.

`-Destination` chooses another directory; the script prints the `export` line
that points the crate at it. `-Quiet` suppresses that.

macOS is untested: the hand-link uses `--whole-archive`, a GNU ld and lld flag.

## Discovery order

At runtime the library is looked for in:

1. `FMETRICS_LIB_PATH` or `FMETRICS_LIB_DIR`
2. The directory holding the running executable
3. Platform system directories
4. Bare names, letting the platform loader's own search path apply

Staging the library beside the executable is therefore enough.

## Availability

```rust
# use av_metrics_fmetrics::is_available;
if !is_available() {
    // No fmetrics on this machine; scoring is unavailable.
}
```

Cheap to call: the library is resolved once and cached.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test -p av-metrics-fmetrics
```

Tests that need the library skip themselves when it is absent, so the suite passes
on a machine without it.

## Benchmarks

One example reports three numbers, because one cannot answer the question a
caller has:

- **end-to-end** — decode and score a pair as the scorer is actually driven.
  Comparable against another engine's end-to-end figure.
- **library only** — score pre-converted frames, so decode and conversion are
  out of the timed region. This is what says whether the library itself
  parallelises; end-to-end cannot, because decode does not.
- **conversion only** — the YUV to RGB conversion on its own, which is roughly
  half of fmetrics' per-frame cost and cannot be inferred from the other two.

```sh
# Everything, single-threaded.
cargo run --release -p av-metrics-fmetrics --example bench -- ref.mkv dist.mkv

# Through 12 threads, 200 frames per thread.
cargo run --release -p av-metrics-fmetrics --example bench -- ref.mkv dist.mkv 12 200
```

Scores are printed with the timings throughout: a speedup that changes the
numbers is not a speedup. `identical_to_serial` in the library-only section
asserts that concurrent scoring through distinct workspaces is bit-identical to a
serial run, which is the property the whole threading design rests on.
