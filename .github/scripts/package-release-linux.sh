# .SYNOPSIS
#     Packs the staged Linux release into a zip with the layout the binary needs.
#
# .DESCRIPTION
#     The Linux mirror of package-release.ps1. The release assets form a
#     directory, not a pile of loose files, because the runtime resolves parts
#     of it by relative path:
#
#       * VMAF models must sit in `model/` beside the executable.
#         av-metrics-vmaf searches `<exe dir>/model`, so a flat layout
#         silently fails to find them and VMAF is reported unavailable with
#         no other symptom.
#       * The metric libraries must sit beside the executable. fmetrics probes
#         the executable's directory itself, but vmaf and vship do not: they
#         try environment overrides and then bare names, and the ELF loader
#         never searches the executable's own directory. A `$ORIGIN` runpath
#         is therefore written into the binary before packing, which makes the
#         extracted directory work with no environment variables set.
#
#     The executable bit is the other thing a zip does not carry by default.
#     Entries are written one at a time with the Unix mode in the external
#     attribute field, and the archive is verified afterward the same way the
#     PowerShell script verifies its own.
#
# .PARAMETER StageDir
#     Directory holding the staged release. Defaults to `target/release`.
#
# .PARAMETER OutputPath
#     Where to write the archive. Defaults to `target/condor-linux-x64.zip`.
#

#     ./.github/scripts/package-release-linux.sh
