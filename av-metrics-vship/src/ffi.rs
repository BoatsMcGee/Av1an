//! Hand-written declarations for the libvship C API.
//!
//! libvship is opened with [`libloading`] rather than linked, so the crate has
//! no build-time dependency on it and compiles on machines where it is absent.
//! No `bindgen` is used: the surface needed here is small and stable, and
//! declaring it by hand keeps the build free of a libclang dependency.
//!
//! Every struct layout, enum discriminant and function signature below was
//! transcribed from `src/VshipAPI.h` and `src/VshipColor.h` in the Vship
//! repository at tag v5.1.2, not inferred.
//!
//! # Loading strategy
//!
//! The [`Library`] is deliberately leaked by [`VshipApi::load`], so the code
//! its function pointers refer to stays mapped for the life of the process.
//! Only the pointers are kept in [`VshipApi`]; since raw `fn` pointers are
//! `Send + Sync`, the resolved API can then be cached in a `OnceLock` and
//! shared freely.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! libvship is compiled per-backend. Since v5.1.2, Vulkan initialization is
//! lazy and a missing driver is reported through the library's API; other
//! backends may still fail to load when their runtime libraries are missing.
