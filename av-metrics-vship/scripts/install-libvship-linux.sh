# .SYNOPSIS
#     Builds libvship from source and installs the shared library for Linux.
#
# .DESCRIPTION
#     Installs libvship so av-metrics-vship can load it at runtime with
#     `libloading`. Unlike Windows, where each release publishes a prebuilt DLL
#     per backend, upstream publishes no Linux assets at all, so this compiles
#     from source.
#
#     `Backend` selects the compute backend. Vulkan is the default because its
#     only imports are libvulkan.so.1 and libc/libstdc++/libm/libgcc_s, so one
#     build runs against any working NVIDIA, AMD or Intel Vulkan driver and needs
#     no vendor redistributable. `nvidia` and `amd` require the CUDA and ROCm
#     runtimes respectively.
#
#     The library is installed by hand rather than via `make install`, which
#     depends on an `uninstall` target and would also symlink into
#     $(PREFIX)/lib/vapoursynth. Only the shared library is needed, because the
#     crate `dlopen`s it.
#
#     This script is standalone: it needs no repository checkout and nothing
#     beside itself. The release pipeline overrides the pins below with
#     environment variables instead of editing the defaults.
#
# .PARAMETER Destination
#     Where to place `libvship.so`. Defaults to `$PWD/vship`.
#
# .PARAMETER Backend
#     Which upstream build to compile: `vulkan`, `cuda` or `amd`.
#
# .PARAMETER Version
#     libvship release tag to build. Defaults to the pinned tag below.
#
# .PARAMETER Commit
#     The commit to build. Defaults to the pinned revision of `Version`.
#
# .PARAMETER Quiet
#     Suppress the environment-variable guidance printed at the end.
#
# .EXAMPLE
#     ./install-libvship-linux.sh
#
# .EXAMPLE
#     ./install-libvship-linux.sh -Backend cuda -Destination /usr/lib

# its pins without editing this script.

Set this environment variable to use the install:

  export VSHIP_LIB_DIR='$Destination'

Not needed when the library sits beside the condor binary, which is where a
release stages it; the crate searches there on its own.

Verify with:

  cargo test -p av-metrics-vship

Tests needing the library skip themselves when it is absent, so a pass alone
does not prove it loaded.
